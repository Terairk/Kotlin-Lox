# Kotlin-Lox
This is my version of the Lox programming language from the Crafting Interpreters book written in Kotlin -
This is adapted from Java but using Kotlin's idiomatic syntax and features. 
I hope to add additional features in addition the ones mentioned in the book 


I also hope to maybe implement the C version of Lox using Kotlin/Native instead.
